A simple React App for a pizza menu.

Contains a menu with photos, prices, ingredients, and names of different types of pizzas.

The footer contains dynamic text that changes based on the time of day. 
If it is within opening hours, the text will display the time and say that we are open.
If not, it will display the time and say we are closed and include the opeing hours for the restaurant.

**Updated:

Now contains further detail, and functionality. I have included several ternary operators to change the appearance based on conditions.
Sold-out goods now appear grey with the price showing SOLD OUT, and I have also added an order button.
