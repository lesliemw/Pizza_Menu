A simple React App for a pizza menu.

Contains a menu with photos, prices, ingredients, and names of different types of pizzas.

The footer contains dynamic text that changes based on the time of day. 
If it is within opening hours, the text will display the time and say that we are open.
If not, it will display the time and say we are closed and include the opeing hours for the restaurant.
